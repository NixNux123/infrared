  gateways:
    # This is just the name of this gateway.
    # Since is your only gateways right now I would call it "default".
    # These names ARE global. Make sure to not have duplicates.
    #
    default:
      listeners:
        # Same as the gateway. This is just the name of the listener.
        # Since is binds to port 25565 it makes sense that it is called
        # default for now.
        # These names ARE global. Make sure to not have duplicates.

        default:

  servers:
    # This is again just the name of the server.
    # These names ARE global. Make sure to not have duplicates.
    #
    default:
      # We link this server to our default gateway.
      # That means that players that connect through any listener
      # in our "default" gateway can connect to this server.
      #
      gateways:
        - default
      
      # This is the domain that players enter in their game client.
      # You can have multiple domains here or just one.
      # Currently this holds just a wildcard character as a domain
      # meaning that is accepts every domain that a player uses.
      # More about wildcard characters: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character

      domains:
